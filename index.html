                <h2>Understanding Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Perspectives</h2>
                
<p>Indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) are deeply rooted in the traditions, experiences, and relationships that Indigenous peoples have cultivated with the land, water, and all living beings over generations. These systems encompass a vast range of knowledge, including environmental stewardship, medicine, storytelling, governance, and ways of teaching and learning. Unlike Western knowledge, which often prioritizes written records and compartmentalized disciplines, Indigenous knowledge is holistic, experiential, and passed down through oral traditions, ceremony, and practice; it is dynamic and evolves as communities adapt to new challenges while maintaining their cultural foundations.</p><br>


<p>Indigenous perspectives, on the other hand, shape how knowledge is understood and interpreted, offering unique worldviews that emphasize interconnectedness, reciprocity, and responsibility. Indigenous perspectives influence how history, governance, and contemporary issues are approached, often challenging colonial narratives and advocating for more inclusive and holistic ways of thinking. In education, integrating Indigenous perspectives means not only including Indigenous knowledge systems in curricula but also fostering an approach to learning that values relationality, respect, and multiples ways of knowing. Together, Indigenous knowledge systems and perspectives offer valuable insights that can contribute to sustainability, reconciliation, and a deeper understanding of the world.</p><br>


<p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning. In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p>

            <h2>First Peoples Principles of Learning</h2>
            <p>The <em>First Peoples Principles of Learning (FPPL)</em> were developed by Indigenous educators and knowledge keepers in British Columbia. They reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and teaching, and they guide educators in integrating Indigenous perspectives into learning environments. These principles emphasize the holistic, experiential, and relational aspects of learning.</p><br>
