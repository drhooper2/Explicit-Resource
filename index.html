                <h2>Understanding Indigenous Knowledge and Perspective</h2>
                
                <p>Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives refer to the understanding, beliefs, practices, and values developed by Indigenous peoples over generations through deep connections with their lands, cultures, and communities. These knowledge systems are holistic, rooted in lived experiences, and passed down through oral traditions, ceremonies, and storytelling.</p><br>
                <p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning.
                    In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p><br>

                    <p>In B.C.’s redesigned curriculum, Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are integrated throughout all areas of learning and are evident in the curriculum’s rationale statements, goals, big ideas, mandated learning standards, and elaborations.</p> <br>
                    <p>British Columbia's curriculum incorporates <em>Big Ideas, Curricular Competencies,</em> and <em>Content</em> that <em>explicitly</em> includes Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives. This framework is designed to support teachers in authentically integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives into their classrooms.</p><br>
